## What even is?

This is an attempt to make the case why Lyra's dog bed should move into the bedroom.

## Background or current state

Today, Lyra's dog bed is in the main living area.

She prefers to sleep near her pack.

## Our future state

How great would it be if Lyra were to have her own spot in the bedroom, rather than sleeping on the cold floor?

Supporting data includes: 
1. How many snuggles she gives
2. How often she wakes us in the morning

## Known risks

Obviously, L might skip her bed and adopt the human bed...

Further, we should include the cat in future considerations.

## Appendix: Cost of dog beds
