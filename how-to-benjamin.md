# How to Benjamin

Hi there, I‚Äôm Benjamin. This is a working ‚Äòreadme‚Äô on how I operate, and what you can expect from me.

Like me, it‚Äôs a living, breathing document‚Äîand always subject to change :)

## Intro

I use the pronouns **he/him** and am based in Chicago, IL. Before product management, I spent time in marketing and business operations roles. Teach me something new!

I bias toward written communication (1-pagers, etc) as it gives me something to which I can respond; but am happy to jump on a call or to spitball and brainstorm.

## North Star principals

**Prioritize what matters.** I believe you need to take care of yourself first, your family next, and then you can take care of everything else (which includes work). When thinking about work, I prefer clarity and focus: _What problem are we solving?_ and understanding why we decided upon a given bet.

**Think in systems.** Not everything needs to scale, nor be long-lasting. I like breaking things down to undersatnd how each bit fits and works together; and what tradeoffs we‚Äôre making, by designing something in a particular manner. I probably bias toward being verbose and possibly exposing too much functionality/‚Äòwork‚Äô on clients or customers.

**Ask lots of questions.** I love asking questions! Even if I suspect I know why something is a certain way, I find that asking questions can elicit different context. Often times, I learn something new‚Äîand that helps change my own perspective! I‚Äôd rather you over-communicate and ask more questions, so we can do our best to understand one-another‚Äôs positions.

**Simplify.** And then simplify it again. I believe this is some of the hardest work, but when you get it right, it‚Äôs ‚ú® magical ‚ú®

**Be kind.** We won‚Äôt always agree on everything. That‚Äôs probably good! But when facing disagreements, I strongly prefer that we respectfully and kindly explore our positions. I believe that building great products happens best when we‚Äôre operating as a strong team. As humans, we have distractions, emotions; we have both bad and good days; we have a world beyond work. Just remember that we‚Äôre all people living our own lives.

**Bias toward action.**

## Frameworks

As a product manager, I lean on a few approaches depending on the context:
1. **[Kano model](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/kano-model/)** for early-stage work.
2. **[RICE](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/)** for more established work.

## Words

Some other terms you might hear me use:
* **[SBAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAR):** A tool for communicating impactful decisions.
* Is a decision a **‚Äòone way door‚Äô** or a **‚Äòtwo way door‚Äô**? aka Is this easily-reversable? (From [Amazon](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html).)
* Are we ‚Äòbike shedding‚Äô or ‚Äòyak shaving‚Äô? ([defintions](https://kaushik.page/blog/yak-shaving-bike-shedding/))

## Feedback

I‚Äôm here to learn, and to get better at my craft!

The best‚Äîand sometimes hardest‚Äîpart of product management imho is adapting to the project/team/environment, as every organization is different (and constantly changing). _Every_ perspective is valid, and I‚Äôm üôè grateful for you trusting me to grow, and to get better.

## Meetings

People often say meetings are bad. I‚Ä¶might disagree? Meetings are another tool, and we‚Äôre all different humans trying to do big things, together.

That said, I think of meetings in a few different contexts:
* **Recurring sync:** Team meetings, standups, stakeholder review sessions, etc. These should have notes with any action-items, and should be scheduled at a regular cadence (eg. bi-weekly). Open to anyone interested.
* **1x1:** Same as previously, except between two humans. More informal, but I still believe in shared agendas/notes.
* **Decision moment:** Do we need to align on a direction and/or make some decisions? Ideally, a pre-read (such as a 1-pager) has been shared. Also helpful: Is this a one-way or a two-way door?

If you want bonus points, please schedule any recurring meetings on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. If we have a long weekend (or if I‚Äôm taking a long weekend myself) I‚Äôd love not needing to re-schedule everything from a Friday or a Monday‚Ä¶

## Etc

I love [my pup](https://lyra.dog). I will close my laptop to take her for walks. When we get home, I‚Äôm happy to jump on again to review updates and whatnot.

I use my computing devices as my ‚Äòexternal brain‚Äô and rely upon my calendar, notes and reminders. I generally try to share what I have, and/or to work in public. Feel free to ask if you want me to publish my notes, or to elaborate on anything.

I like ‚òïÔ∏è coffee.
