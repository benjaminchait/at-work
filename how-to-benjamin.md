# How to Benjamin

Hi there, I’m Benjamin. This is a working ‘readme’ on how I operate, and what you can expect from me.

Like me, it’s a living, breathing document—and always subject to change :)

## Intro

I use the pronouns **he/him** and am based in Chicago, IL. Before **product management**, I spent time in _marketing_ and _business operations_ roles. Teach me something new!

I bias toward **written communication** (1-pagers, etc) as it gives me something to which I can respond; but am happy to jump on a call or to spitball and brainstorm.

## North Star principals

**Prioritize what matters.** I believe you need to take care of yourself first, your family next, and then you can take care of everything else (which includes work). When thinking about work, I prefer clarity and focus: _What problem are we solving?_ and understanding why we decided upon a given bet.

**Think in systems.** Not everything needs to scale, nor be long-lasting. I like breaking things down to understand how each bit fits and works together; and what tradeoffs we’re making, by designing something in a particular manner. I probably bias toward being verbose and possibly exposing too much functionality/‘work’ on clients or customers. But if we talk about the _system_ and how this product piece fits within the whole, I hope we come up with the right-sized solution for where we are _today_.

**Ask lots of questions.** I love asking questions! Even if I suspect I know why something is a certain way, I find that asking questions can elicit different context. Often times, I learn something new—and that helps change my own perspective! I’d rather you over-communicate and ask more questions, so we can do our best to understand one-another’s positions.

**Simplify.** And then simplify it again. I believe this is some of the hardest work, but when you get it right, it’s ✨ magical ✨

**Be kind.** We won’t always agree on everything. That’s good! But when facing disagreements, I strongly prefer that we respectfully and kindly explore our positions. Help me understand where you’re coming from! I believe that building great products happens best when we’re operating as a strong team. As humans, we have distractions, emotions; we have both bad and good days; we have a world beyond work. Just remember that we’re all people living our own lives, and to do good work.

**Bias toward action.**

## Frameworks

As a product manager, I lean on a few approaches depending on the context:
1. **[Kano model](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/kano-model/)** for early-stage work.
2. **[RICE](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/)** for more established work.
3. **Working backwards** is helpful as a _what must be true?_ when exploring a long-term vision, or a specific, targeted commitment. I especially like this when thinking about specific dates; and lean on a _work back schedule_, taken from work on live events.
4. **[Jobs To Be Done](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/jobs-to-be-done-framework/)**.
5. I like working with clear agreements on how we make decisions. Previously, I’ve enjoyed both the **[RAPID](https://thinkinsights.net/strategy/rapid-decisions/)** and the **[RACI](https://racichart.org/the-raci-model/)** approaches; more important than a singular approach is that we agree on _how_ and _when_ we use these.

## Feedback

I’m here to learn, and to get better at my craft!

The best—and sometimes hardest—part of product management imho is adapting to the project/team/environment, as every organization is different (and constantly changing). _Every_ perspective is valid, and I’m 🙏 grateful for you trusting me to grow, and to get better.

I find it most helpful for you to let me know in real-time, and include specifics on what or how I can improve. If a chat might be helpful, send me a message and we can find some time to talk!

## Meetings

People often say meetings are bad. I…might disagree? Meetings are another tool, and we’re all different humans trying to do big things, together.

That said, I think of meetings in a few different contexts:
* **Recurring sync:** Team meetings, standups, stakeholder review sessions, etc. These should have notes with any action-items, and should be scheduled at a regular cadence (eg. bi-weekly). Open to anyone interested.
* **1x1:** Same as previously, except between two humans. More informal, but I still believe in shared agendas/notes.
* **Decision moment:** Do we need to align on a direction and/or make some decisions? Ideally, a pre-read (such as a 1-pager) has been shared. Also helpful: Is this a one-way or a two-way door?

If you want bonus points, please schedule any recurring meetings on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. If we have a long weekend (or if I’m taking a long weekend myself) I’d love not needing to re-schedule everything from a Friday or a Monday…

## Etc

I love [my pup](https://lyra.dog). I will close my laptop to take her for walks. When we get home, I’m happy to jump on again to review updates and whatnot.

I use my computing devices as my ‘external brain’ and rely upon my calendar, notes and reminders. I generally try to share what I have, and/or to work in public. Feel free to ask if you want me to publish my notes, or to elaborate on anything.

I like ☕️ coffee.
