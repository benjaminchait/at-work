# How to Benjamin

Hi there, I’m Benjamin. This is a working ‘readme’ on how I operate, and what you can expect from me.

Like me, it’s a living, breathing document—and always subject to change :)

## Contacting me

I’m very connected, and probably online most hours of the day.

I bias toward written communication (1-pagers, email, Slack). You can (and should!) call if it’s warranted, but I try to be as responsive as my schedule permits.

My calendar is public! If time is showing as available, feel free to add something to it—you don’t have to ask permission first. Just know that I might want to reschedule, and I do appreciate if you share but give me permission to change the event too.

If I’m not ‘working,’ it’s likely I won’t be looking at messages nor email. This is especially true if I’m on PTO. _Use your best judgement on important something is! I have a cell phone for a reason…_

## Some background

I’m a **product manager** by day, but my career path hasn’t been linear.

I’m from Boulder, Colorado originally. My college years started in DC, but I transferred and graduated from the University of Colorado studying English literature and mathematics. I fell into tech working at Apple in higher-ed marketing/sales before spending time in retail and training. After taking a year off, I joined a PDX banking startup called Simple and worked in marketing and business ops, before shifting into product. In 2019, I moved to SF and helped start a new digital challenger bank called ONE. And in 2021, I was a technical product manager at Chime helping build a financial platform. _You can read more [on my personal site](https://benjaminchait.net)._

## North Star principals

**Prioritize what matters.** I believe you need to take care of yourself first, your family next, and then you can take care of everything else (which includes work).

**Think in systems.** Not everything needs to scale, nor be long-lasting. But when building meaningful products, I prefer to think about how each bit fits and works together; and what tradeoffs we’re taking, by designing something in a particular manner. I probably bias toward being verbose and possibly exposing too much functionality/‘work’ on clients or customers.

**Ask lots of questions.** I love asking questions! Even if I suspect I know why something is a certain way, I find that asking questions can elicit different context. Often times, I learn something new—and that helps change my own perspective! I’d rather you over-communicate and ask more questions, so we can do our best to understand one-another’s positions.

**Simplify.** And then simplify it again. I believe this is some of the hardest work, but when you get it right, it’s ✨ magical ✨

**Acknowledge we’re all human.** I believe that building great products happens best when we’re operating as a strong team. As humans, we have distractions, emotions; we have both bad and good days; we have a world beyond work. Just remember that we’re all people living our own lives.

**Bias toward action.**

**Be kind.** We won’t always agree on everything. That’s probably good! But when facing disagreements, I strongly prefer that we respectfully and kindly explore our positions.

## Feedback

I’m here to learn, and to get better at my craft!

The best—and sometimes hardest—part of product management imho is adapting to the project/team/environment, as every organization is different (and constantly changing). _Every_ perspective is valid, and I’m 🙏 grateful for you trusting me to grow, and to get better.

## Meetings

People often say meetings are bad. I…might disagree? Meetings are another tool, and we’re all different humans trying to do big things, together.

That said, I think of meetings in a few different contexts:
* Recurring syncs: Team meetings, standups, stakeholder review sessions, etc. These should have notes with any action-items, and should be scheduled at a regular cadence (eg. bi-weekly). Open to anyone interested.
* 1x1s: Same as previously, except between two humans. More informal, but I still believe in shared agendas/notes.
* Problem solving: Do we need to align on a direction and/or make some decisions? Ideally, a pre-read (such as a 1-pager) has been shared. Also helpful: Is this a one-way or a two-way door?

If you want bonus points, please schedule any recurring meetings on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. If we have a long weekend (or if I’m taking a long weekend myself) I’d love not needing to re-schedule everything from a Friday or a Monday…

## Etc

I love [my pup](https://lyra.dog). I will close my laptop to take her for walks. When we get home, I’m happy to jump on again to review updates and whatnot.
