## DRI

_DRI_ stands for _Directly Responsible Individual_: I really like this concept. That person need not _do_ all the work, but they are _responsible_ for delegating and/or understanding the work for which they are assigned as the DRI. Taken from .

## SBAR

_SBAR_ stands for _Situation-Background-Analysis-Recommendation_: [SBAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAR), a tool for communicating impactful decisions.
