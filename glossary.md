# A glossary of interesting acronyms, terms and words

These are some terms you might hear me use. I add to this periodically, and welcome feedback if I use unfamiliar terms.

## ack

Shorthand for _acknowledge_.

## DRI

_DRI_ stands for _Directly Responsible Individual_: I really like this concept. That person need not _do_ all the work, but they are _responsible_ for delegating and/or understanding the work for which they are assigned as the DRI. Taken from .

## first principles

_[First principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)_ starts with axioms or truths that we must believe, and works from those to identify/explore possible solutions to complex problems. Rather than starting with what exists today, we might explore solutions based on if we started building this entirely from scratch.

## lgtm

Shorthand for _looks good to me_.

---

## MECE

_[MECE principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle): "mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive." Are the options mutually exclusive, or does overlap exist? Are the proposed options collectively exhaustive, or merely representative of some possibilities?

## rubber ducking

It's usually helpful to talk things through. In the absence of a forum for this, just saying it out loud to others can be helpful to improve thoughtfulness and clarity.

## SBAR

_SBAR_ stands for _Situation-Background-Analysis-Recommendation_: [SBAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAR), a tool for communicating impactful decisions.

_See [sbar](templates/sbar.md) template._

## SWAG

_SWAG_ stands for _Scientific Wild A** Guess_. This should be an informed estimate, but...slightly imprecise!
